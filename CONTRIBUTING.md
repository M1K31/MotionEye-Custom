# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for local development and testing instructions.

Quick start:

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` for macOS setup and venv instructions.
2. Run `./setup_dev.sh` to create the venv and install dependencies.
3. Run `python -m pytest -q` to run the test suite.

If you need CI help, open an issue and mention your platform (macOS/Linux) and Python version.
