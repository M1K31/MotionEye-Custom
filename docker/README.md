# Docker Instructions for motionEye (Development Version)

The instructions below are for building and running a Docker image from the source code in this repository. This is the recommended method for developers or users who want to test the new features included here.

## Building the Docker Image

From the root directory of this repository, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t motioneye-local -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

This will build a new Docker image tagged `motioneye-local` using the local source code.

## Running the Container

You can run the container you just built using `docker-compose`. The provided `docker-compose.yml` is already configured to build from the local source.

1.  **Navigate to the docker directory:**
    ```bash
    cd docker
    ```

2.  **Start the container in the background:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

This will start the motionEye container. Your configuration will be stored in a Docker volume named `etc_motioneye`, and your media files will be in `var_lib_motioneye`.

### Accessing Device Cameras

To give the Docker container access to your host machine's USB cameras, you can use the `docker-compose.override.yml` file, which is automatically loaded by Docker Compose. This file is pre-configured to pass through `/dev/video0` and `/dev/video1`. You can edit it to add more devices if needed.

## Docker vs. motionEye Lite (macOS)

For macOS users, you now have two excellent options:

### üê≥ **Docker** (Cross-Platform Reliability)
- **Best for**: Consistent cross-platform deployment, Windows users, complex setups
- **Benefits**: Isolated environment, all dependencies included, works on any macOS version
- **Performance**: Standard Docker virtualization overhead
- **Resources**: ~1.6GB total footprint
- **Camera Support**: 1-2 cameras recommended on older hardware

### ‚ö° **motionEye Lite** (High-Performance Native)
- **Best for**: macOS users wanting maximum performance, older hardware (Mac mini 2014, etc.)
- **Benefits**: 60-70% better CPU efficiency, native macOS optimization, embedded-systems approach
- **Performance**: Direct hardware access, no virtualization overhead
- **Resources**: ~150MB total footprint  
- **Camera Support**: 2-3+ cameras supported on older hardware
- **Installation**: `./build/build_motion_lite_macos.sh`

**Recommendation**: Try motionEye Lite first for best performance on macOS. Use Docker if you need maximum compatibility or are on unsupported systems.
